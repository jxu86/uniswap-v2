# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
# 部署测试环境
```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network goerli
```

# Hardhat Verify
```sh
npx hardhat verify --network goerli ${contractAddress}
```
